<h1>**NUTIRMATE-FETAURE-CALORIE-METER**</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nutrimate's sub-feature offers users a dynamic tool for setting and tracking daily calorie goals. Upon setting a goal, users are greeted with a visually engaging circular progress bar that represents their target. As users deduct or add calories throughout the day, the circular bar updates in real-time, providing a clear visual indication of progress. Upon reaching their goal, users receive a congratulatory message accompanied by sparkling effects, celebrating their achievement.

Additionally, users have the flexibility to set multiple goals per day, allowing them to tailor their targets to their specific needs and preferences. For added convenience, users can access their goal history through the "View History" button. This feature enables users to filter their history by dates, providing detailed insights into their past performance. Users also have the option to delete specific entries, allowing them to manage their history effectively.

Furthermore, Nutrimate provides users with valuable resources to support their health and wellness journey. Users can access tips for maintaining a balanced diet and can explore product details, including calorie information per serving. Additionally, users can view nutritional information for each product, represented in intuitive line bars, empowering them to make informed choices about their dietary intake. With these comprehensive features, Nutrimate ensures users have the tools they need to achieve their health and fitness goals effectively.
<h5>Future Enhancement</h5>In future enhancements, our goal is to personalize this feature by making it unique to each user through the utilization of their unique user ID (UID). Currently, the feature allows all users to access and view the history of other users, which compromises privacy and personalization. By implementing user-specific UIDs, we aim to tailor the experience to each individual, ensuring that users can only access and interact with their own data. This enhancement will enhance security and privacy while also providing a more personalized and seamless experience for each user.</p>
